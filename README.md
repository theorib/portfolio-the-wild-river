## Context

This project was written by me from the ground up using TypeScript, Next.js and Tailwind CSS. It was inspired by the final project from ['The Ultimate React Course 2024: React, Redux & More'](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-ultimate-react-course/) by [Jonas Schmedtmann](https://codingheroes.io/) completed February 2024 but there isn't a single component or function that was copied from the course. They where all written from the ground up for this project.
